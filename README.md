## /bin

### [/bin/untilfail](/bin/untilfail)

Ever had to debug a non-deterministic program or wondered if some behavior of your code is truly flaky? The `untilfail` binary helps you find reproducers for such cases. Just pass the respective command to your program and it will execute the command until it fails. We recommend adding additional outputs to your command until you have isolated your program.

```bash
untilfail some-program-with-a-bug
```

You can even specify a timeout in case youâ€™re out hunting for infinite loops.

```bash
untilfail -t 10 some-program-with-an-infinite-bug
```

For additional arguments and options you can take a look at the help.

```bash
untilfail -h
```
